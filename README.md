# Tic Tac Toe

It is time to make a working game so you can play it with a friend.\
First one of you moves as X, and then the other one moves as

I have created a game loop. The game starts with empty cells and ends when someone wins or there is a draw. The final result is shown after the end of the game.

The game is played on the basis of coordinates. The coordinates are as follows-\
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)\
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)\
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)


#### Example

The example below shows how the program should work.
